This repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start) and [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) environment. For the Foundry installation follow the instructions through the [link](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

### Getting Started

 * Use Foundry: 
```bash
forge install
forge test
```

 * Use Hardhat:
```bash
npm install  ||  yarn
npx hardhat test
```

### Features

 * Write / run tests with either Hardhat or Foundry:
```bash
forge test  ||  yarn test
#Â or
npx hardhat test  ||  yarn testhh
```

 * Install libraries with Foundry which work with Hardhat.
```bash
forge install rari-capital/solmate # Already in this repo, just an example
```

### Notes

Whenever you install new libraries using Foundry, make sure to update your `remappings.txt` file by running `forge remappings > remappings.txt`. This is required because we use `hardhat-preprocessor` and the `remappings.txt` file to allow Hardhat to resolve libraries you install with Foundry.
